    "- The last expression (a) is evaluated as 6\n",

    "#### Explaination in for all stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) In the initial stage:\n",
    "   - Module initializes with `a = 0` (global variable)\n",
    "   - Function `b()` uses the global variable `a`\n",
    "   - Function `c(a)` takes a parameter and returns `a + 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Each call to `b()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First `b()` call:\n",
    "   - `a` is 0 (initial value)\n",
    "   - `b()` calls `c(0)`\n",
    "   - `c(0)` returns 0 + 2 = 2\n",
    "   - So, the global `a` becomes 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second `b()` call:\n",
    "   - `a` is 2 (from previous call)\n",
    "   - `b()` calls `c(2)`\n",
    "   - `c(2)` returns 2 + 2 = 4\n",
    "   - So, the global `a` becomes 4\n",
    "\n",
    "- Third `b()` call:\n",
    "   - `a` is 4 (from previous call)\n",
    "   - `b()` calls `c(4)`\n",
    "   - `c(4)` returns 4 + 2 = 6\n",
    "   - So, the global `a` becomes 6\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Finally, `a` is evaluated:\n",
    "   - It displays 6 (the latest/current value of the global variable `a`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, 6 is displayed when the last expression is evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE:\n",
    "- The `global` keyword in `b()` ensures we're modifying the module-level variable `a`\n",
    "- Each call to `b()` increases the value of `a` by 2 via function `c()`\n",
    "- Three calls result in three increases of value 2. From starting of 0: 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6"
